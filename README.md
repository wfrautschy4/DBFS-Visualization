    ```bash
    cd your-repo-name
    ```
3. Open ```depthVisualization.html``` or ```breadthVisualization.html``` in your browser

## Usage 
1. Generate a graph of random nodes and edges between them
2. Chose between using depth or breadth first search depending on the file you open
3. Adjust visualization settings like speed, auto-traversal, and navigating more than one node per step
